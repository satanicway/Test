# Test Simulator

This repository contains a small Python script `sim.py` that demonstrates a
lightweight board game combat simulation. It defines several heroes, a few
example enemies and implements mechanics such as Fate, vulnerability and some
card effects. The script is not a full recreation of the original game but
offers a framework for experimentation.

Run the simulator with:

```bash
python3 sim.py
```

It will pick random heroes and enemies and report the win rate for 20 runs.
