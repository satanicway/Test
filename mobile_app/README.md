# mobile_app

This Flutter project was initialized in a constrained environment. The standard `flutter create` command could not be executed, so only a minimal scaffold is provided.

To fully initialize the project, run `flutter create .` inside this directory once Flutter is installed.

## Building

After running `flutter create .` and fetching dependencies you can generate the platform binaries with:

```bash
flutter build apk   # Build Android APK
flutter build ios   # Build iOS app
```
